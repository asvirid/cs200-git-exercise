# CS200 - Software Engineering Workshop 


The following exercise is going to require that you do the following:

- [ ] Fork this project
- [ ] Create a branch with your name e.g `emmanuel-file-creation`
- [ ] Change the python file and run it 
- [ ] Commit the changes upstream
- [ ] Create a pull request



## Python 

The python file that you have to edit is called `file_creator.py`. This is mainly a git exercise, so once you clone the project and 
make the python changes in the file (follow the comments in the code) and depending on your version of python run the following:

For mac users that have python3 has your default: `python file_creator.py` 
For mac users that do not have python3 as your default: `python3 file_creator.py`

Windows users: `python file_creator.py`

After you run the pyhon code, commit the changes, and make a PR to this repository. 


Good luck!
